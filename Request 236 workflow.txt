Both -001 PS codes appear to have identical WQ data--based on eye test,
	strange because the duplicate (013-001) was created in April 2022
Both -003 PS codes appear to have identical WQ data--based on eye test,
	strange because the duplicate (013-001) was created in April 2022
	
	
NEXT STEPS
* Confirm via query that both pairs of duplicate PS codes have identical water quality data
	- Modify Request 236 SDWIS_WQData_Qry
* William to look at lab reports for clues
* Set up Teams meeting with Paul, Gilbert (for CLIP insight),William, and myself to discuss--attach the notes from this file
as the agenda, along with the query
* If data is identical, then delete the duplicate PS codes generated by batch

NOTES FROM WILLIAM
	- District Office may have given incorrect PS code information to the water system, may have caused
	  lab to upload WQ data with wrong PS codes to CLIP; CLIP then generated wrong PS codes
